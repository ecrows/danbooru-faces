# danbooru-faces

Jupyter notebooks for cropping and processing anime faces from Gwern's Danbooru2017 dataset.  I made this for my own personal GAN projects, and hope it might be useful for others.

# Demonstration

Future work to be done towards adding mirror-padding and stabilization akin to the CelebA-HQ dataset prepared by NVIDIA.

# Requirements:
* numpy
* OpenCV
* [lbpcascade_animeface](https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface)
* Some collection of anime-style images (I used Danbooru2017 SFW from Gwern)
